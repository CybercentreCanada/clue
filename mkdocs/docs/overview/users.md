# Clue From The User's Perspective

Users will generally encounter Clue through other apps integrating it into their UI, although it can also be used on it's own if necessary. Here are the different ways Clue can be used:

## Enriched data

One of the ways Clue can be used in other apps is by enriching existing data, by replacing a simple component such as a Chip or Typography with an enriched version. This enriched data can show icons to represent either an Assessment (such as an IP assessed as "false-positive"), an Opinion (such as a Hostname being designated "suspicious") or additional Context (such as a country flag for a geolocated IP).

This enriched data can also be interacted with by clicking, which will show a Details Popover. In this Popover, you can find what information each plugin provided in regards to the relevant data. In this menu, you have quick filters allowing you to refine which enrichments to display, external links to the different plugin providers, as well as icon buttons for different actions that can be done, such as refresh the query, copy to clipboard, execute additional enrichment or execute actions.

## Executing Actions

Clue also allows users to execute certain plugin-specific actions. These actions will be shown under the "Execute" button in the Clue Popover, and can be selected to, for example, pivot to another app, or submit the data to a different application. Some actions will require additional information, and so might display a form prompting for the missing info.
